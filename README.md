Code for comnpariosn of PIDForest, KNN, DTM and other algorithm for anomaly detection om basis of AUC-ROC score and AP score

The [accompanying Paper ](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9274-statistical-analysis-of-nearest-neighbor-methods-for-anomaly-detection.pdf) for DTM explains the algorithm and gives a comparitive study on benchmark algorithms.

The [accompanying paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03582) shows that PIDForest performs favorably in comparison to several popular anomaly detection methods, across a broad range of benchmarks. PIDForest also provides a succinct explanation for why a point is labelled anomalous, by providing a set of features and ranges for them which are relatively uncommon in the dataset.
